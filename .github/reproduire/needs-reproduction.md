We need a minimal reproduction to be able to triage this issue.

### Why do we need a minimal reproduction?

Reproductions allow the team to triage and fix issues quickly with a relatively small team. They help us identify the source of the problem and verify that the issue is not caused by something specific to your project.

### How can I create a reproduction?

Please use one of the following starter templates to create a minimal reproduction:

| Framework | CodeSandbox Template |
|-----------|---------------------|
| Angular | [stencil-angular-starter](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/johnjenkins/stencil-angular-starter/) |
| NextJs | [stencil-starter-next](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/johnjenkins/stencil-starter-next/) |
| React | [stencil-starter-react](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/johnjenkins/stencil-starter-react/) |
| Vue | [stencil-starter-vue](https://codesandbox.io/p/github/johnjenkins/stencil-starter-vue/) |

A reproduction should be **as minimal as possible**. This means removing any code that is not directly related to the issue. The less code there is, the easier it is to identify the problem.

You can also provide a link to a public GitHub repository that demonstrates the issue.

### What happens next?

- If you provide a valid reproduction link, this issue will be triaged and addressed based on priority.
- If no reproduction is provided within **7 days**, this issue may be automatically closed.
- You can always reopen the issue by providing a reproduction link.
